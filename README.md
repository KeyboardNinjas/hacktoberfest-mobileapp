# Hacktoberfest Mobile App
Inspired by the [HacktoberFest Checker](https://github.com/jenkoian/hacktoberfest-checker). Keep track of all your friends hacktober progress as well as your own right on your phone! (Currently only Android supported, will add iOS support later on)

# Why?
Created to keep track of all of your friends also participating in hacktober to ensure that you are ahead of them ;).And also just to be an awsome project for hacktoberfest!

# Contribution
* Not too many rules. Just grab an already approved issue and go ahead and code! If you want to add a awesome new feature to the project just open a issue with an explaination why you would like to add the feature and wait for a maintainer to approve the issue and then you may go forth!
* By contributing get your name added to the colaborators list and also into the app.

# Colaborators

* Thanks to [Ian Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkoian) for his [HacktoberFest Checker](https://github.com/jenkoian/hacktoberfest-checker) repo that inspired everything! Also want to give kuddos to him for his API code that makes all of this possible.
